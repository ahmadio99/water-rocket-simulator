# 🚀 Water Rocket Simulator

## 📦 Requirements (Install These First)
Before running the game, make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

Install the required packages by running:
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic

These are needed for:
- fastapi → main web framework (serves pages, handles WebSockets, API routes)
- uvicorn → ASGI server to run the FastAPI app
- pydantic → data validation and models

---

A multiplayer, physics‑accurate water rocket simulator with live events like sudden wind gusts, leaks, turbo boosts, and storms.

## 📂 Installation & Required Folder Location

⚠️ Important: The game will only work if the files are placed in the correct folder.

1. Go to your Downloads directory.
2. Create a folder named exactly:
   Nouveau dossier
3. Place all the provided files and folders inside Downloads\Nouveau dossier:
   - server.py
   - launch_simulator.bat
   - ngrok (for online play)
   - static folder (contains index.html and other assets)
   - __pycache__ folder (auto‑generated by Python, optional but fine to keep)

Your folder structure should look like this:
Downloads\
└── Nouveau dossier\
    ├── server.py
    ├── launch_simulator.bat
    ├── ngrok
    ├── static\
    │    └── index.html
    └── __pycache__\

## 🎮 Playing Locally
1. Double‑click launch_simulator.bat to start the server and open the game in your browser.
   (Or run python server.py manually if you prefer.)
2. The game will open in your default browser and you can play solo or with others on your local network.

## 🌍 Playing Online with ngrok
1. Download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download if it’s not already included.
2. Place the ngrok executable in the same Nouveau dossier folder.
3. Start your server (see “Playing Locally” above).
4. Open a terminal/command prompt in the Nouveau dossier folder and run:
   ngrok http 3000
   (Replace 3000 with your server’s port if different.)
5. Copy the Forwarding link ngrok gives you and share it with friends — they can use it to connect to your game from anywhere.

## 🕹 How to Play
1. Enter your player name.
2. Adjust launch settings:
   - Bottle volume (L)
   - Bottle diameter (cm)
   - Nozzle diameter (cm)
   - Water volume (L)
   - Air pressure (psi gauge)
   - Soap amount (0–1)
   - Wind speed (m/s)
   - Temperature (°C)
3. (Optional) Enable live events for extra chaos.
4. Hit Launch and watch your rocket fly!
